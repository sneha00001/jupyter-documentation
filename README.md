ðŸ˜Š#jupyter documentation
Welcome to the JupyterLab documentation site. JupyterLab is a highly extensible, feature-rich notebook authoring application and editing environment, and is a part of Project Jupyter, a large umbrella project centered around the goal of providing tools (and standards) for interactive computing with computational notebooks.

A computational notebook is a shareable document that combines computer code, plain language descriptions, data, rich visualizations like 3D models, charts, graphs and figures, and interactive controls. A notebook, along with an editor like JupyterLab, provides a fast interactive environment for prototyping and explaining code, exploring and visualizing data, and sharing ideas with others.

JupyterLab is a sibling to other notebook authoring applications under the Project Jupyter umbrella, like Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Desktop. JupyterLab offers a more advanced, feature rich, customizable experience compared to Jupyter Notebook.

Try JupyterLab on Binder. JupyterLab follows the Jupyter Community Guides.
